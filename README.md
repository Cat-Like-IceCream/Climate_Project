# Figure Replication

This project focuses on replicating the results presented in the paper titled **"Nonlinear temperature effects indicate severe damages to U.S. crop yields under climate change,"** originally authored by Schlenker and Roberts in 2009. The original research, which used STATA for analysis, is accessible [here](https://www.pnas.org/doi/epdf/10.1073/pnas.0906865106).

The goal of this project is to recreate the findings, specifically Figures 1 and 2, using Python. In this repository, you will find the Python notebook titled `FIGURE_REPLICATION.ipynb`, which contains the code I developed to replicate Figures 1 and 2 from the aforementioned paper.


The figures obtained with my code:
