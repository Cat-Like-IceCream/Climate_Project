This is a project on replicating the figures produced in this paper ["Nonlinear temperature effects indicate severe damages to U.S. crop yields under climate change"](https://www.pnas.org/doi/epdf/10.1073/pnas.0906865106) which is originally written in STATA. The published data and replication package from Schlenker and Roberst (2009) can be found [here]( https://www.dropbox.com/sh/kdmufjja1ow0j22/AABhm9NMlRMvAo5ZRgBiZWkIa?dl=0). The Python code I wrote that replicates Figure 1 and Figure 2 in the above paper is in the file "FIGURE_REPLICATION.ipynb"

The figures obtained with my code:
